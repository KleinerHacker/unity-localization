### Keys & Packages
To setup your keys change to project settings and search for `Localization` tab. Here you find setup for fallback language, supported languages and three tables:
* Text values - For texts only
* Sprite values - For sprites like sprite renderer oder UI images
* Material values - For materials used in renderers

Additional you can add custom packages with all keys above for more flexibility and overview.

Use a '/' to create a sub menu in case of choising a key / package. See below.

![demo](https://github.com/KleinerHacker/unity-localization/blob/7b15cdf4fbfd4a92ce57d0804c26077da62cf606/Doc/demo.png)

### Components
* For Texts
  * Localized Text
  * Localized Text Mesh
* For Sprites
  * Localized Sprite (for Sprite Renderer)
  * Localized Image (for UI Image)
* For Materials
  * Localized Renderer (for Renderer)

Each key dropdown of this components shows only the fit keys. Values will update at editor time initial. In game it will update with first frame (method `Start`).

### References
For usage in custom components or assets there are reference types with implicit operators:
* `LocalizedTextRef`
* `LocalizedSpriteRef`
* `LocalizedMaterialRef`

For this types an editor is implemented.

### Text Editing
Change this value to setup an automatic text editing for example fonts that use only upper or lower cases.

### Transliteration
This feature allows to create a transliteration table for each language. So you can transliterate characters that is not supported by gaming font, like Ã¤ -> ae.

### Change Language
* At runtime - Use the class `UnityLocale` to access current settings and change language via `CurrentLanguage`.
* At editor time - Use `Languages` menu in unity to change in scene texts to preview other languages.
